This assumption is not correct. It means signal propagation is not symmetric.
We plot graphs with 4 node pairs:
192.168.2.101 and 192.168.2.109, 192.168.2.102 and 192.168.2.107,
192.168.2.103 and 192.168.2.106, 192.168.2.106 and 192.168.2.110.

In the graph there is points to denote the correlation of link quality between these nodes pair.
For example with case of 192.168.2.106 and 192.168.2.110, there are many points appear in the top-left and bot-right coners,
that mean link quality between these nodes in both ways is not equal (or not symmetric). 
Link quality of 192.168.2.106 to 192.168.2.110 is around 1.0(loss no data), 
but link quality of 192.168.2.110 to 192.168.2.106 is around 0.0 (loss all data).
